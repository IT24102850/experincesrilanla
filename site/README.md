How to view locally:

Option A — Use VS Code Live Server (recommended):
1. Open this folder in VS Code
2. Install "Live Server" extension if you don't have it
3. Right-click on index.html > "Open with Live Server"

Option B — Python simple server (if Python is installed):

```powershell
# from PowerShell in the site/ folder
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps I can help with:
- Convert this scaffold to a CMS or React/Vue site
- Add booking forms that post to a backend or Stripe
- Generate full tour itinerary pages and SEO meta for each page
- Wire affiliate links and analytics (GA4)

If you want, I can now:
- Expand the remaining tour itineraries into full pages and pricing models
- Generate 12 blog posts and meta SEO content
- Produce a simple Node/Express endpoint to receive trip-planner form submissions

Tell me which of the above you want next.
